### Glad to see you here!  
Iâ€™m a full-stack developer who has turned years of freelancing into a full-time career. Being a full-stack allows me to not only develop client-facing apps and websites but also develop it with cutting edge backend support.

I specialize in building robust backends that do all the heavy lifting for your app or website. I love designing systems that are light yet powerful, distributed yet synchronized and beautiful yet effective. I also study blockchain technologies, web3 and support projects in both testnet and mainnet phases. 

Today I have experience supporting projects Obol, Starknet, Namada, Aptos and other more than 20 projects. 

Main stack: NodeJS, ReactJS, Linux, Oracle, Nginx
